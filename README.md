# RealTime-Audio-Transcription-Pi
This project enables real-time audio streaming from a laptop to a Raspberry Pi, where the audio is processed and transcribed into text. Using Python, socket programming, PyAudio, and the SpeechRecognition library, it captures live audio on the laptop, sends it to the Raspberry Pi over a network, and performs speech-to-text transcription on the Pi.
