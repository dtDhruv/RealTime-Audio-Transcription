# RealTime-Audio-Transcription
This project enables real-time audio streaming from one device to another, where the audio is processed and transcribed into text. Using Python, socket programming, PyAudio, and the SpeechRecognition library, it captures live audio on device 1 and sends it to another device over a network, and performs speech-to-text transcription.
